Any modification to this Agreement must be in a writing signed by both you and gotoClassroom. You may not assign any of the rights or obligations granted hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether you are the surviving or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale, consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, except with the prior written consent of gotoClassroom. Any attempted assignment in violation of this paragraph is null and void, and gotoClassroom may terminate this Agreement. This Agreement does not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. Despite the foregoing, you agree that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for gotoClassroom in the event of a breach or threatened breach of a provision of this Agreement protecting gotoClassroom’s intellectual property or Confidential Information, and that in the event of such a breach or threat, gotoClassroom, in addition to any other remedies to which it is entitled, is entitled to such preliminary or injunctive relief (including an order prohibiting Company from taking actions in breach of such provisions), without the need for posting bond, and specific performance as may be appropriate. The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, nor the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) shall apply to this Agreement, regardless of the states in which the parties do business or are incorporated. No waiver by gotoClassroom of any covenant or right under this Agreement will be effective unless memorialized in a writing duly authorized by gotoClassroom. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</li>
